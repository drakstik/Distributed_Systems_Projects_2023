# Naming Server API Specification - Service Interface

Clients use this interface to interact with the naming server. This interface will be created 
using the localhost/127.0.0.1 server address and the port number included in the `namingCommand` 
string defined in `test/ServerCommands.java`.

If the naming server cannot parse a received command, it should respond with `400 Bad Request`.

------

## `/is_valid_path` Command

**Description**: A client uses this command to determine whether a path is valid. The path string must be a sequence of components beginning with and delimited by forward slashes, not including any spaces or colons, e.g., `/dir/file`

### Request from client

**Command**: `/is_valid_path`

**Method**: `POST`

**Input Data**:
```json
{
    "path": "/path/to/file"
}
```

* *path*: The path string described as above.

A sample Java class representing this command can be found at `common/PathRequest.java`.

### Response to client

**Code**: `200 OK`

**Content**:
```json
{
    "success": true
}
```

* *success*: boolean value indicating whether the given path is valid (`true`) or invalid (`false`).

A sample Java class representing this response can be found at `common/BooleanReturn.java`.

## `/get_storage` Command

**Description**: A client uses this command to request IP address and port number of a storage server hosting the file indicated by the path string. If the client intends to perform `read` or `size` commands, it should lock the file for shared access before making this call; if it intends to perform a `write` command, it should lock the file for exclusive access.

### Request from client

**Command**: `/get_storage`

**Method**: `POST`

**Input Data**:
```json
{
    "path": "/path/to/file"
}
```

}
```

## `/lock` Command

**Description**: A client uses this command to lock a file/directory for either shared or exclusive access.  An **exclusive** lock prevents any other client from locking the object for any use until it is unlocked; such locks are typically used for modifying object state. A **shared** lock allows other clients to obtain shared locks for the same object at the same time but not an exclusive lock; such locks are typically used for accessing object state while
ensuring no other client modifies it.

Exclusive locks are safer than shared locks and can be used whenever objects are accessed. However this blocks access to all other clients and reduces system throughput if objects are popular.

The naming server considers each shared lock to be a read request, and it counts such lock calls as the basis for making replication decisions. Locking a file for exclusive access is considered a write request, which may lead to invalidation/deletion of stale replicas.  The naming server must treat all lock actions as read or write requests because it cannot monitor the true read and write actions that take place directly between clients and storage servers.

When any directory/file is locked for either kind of access, all directories along the path up to, but not including, the target directory/file itself are locked for shared access to prevent their modification or deletion by other clients.  For example, if one client locks `/etc/scripts/startup.sh`
for exclusive access to update the script, then `/`, `/etc`, and `/etc/scripts` will all be locked for shared access to prevent conflicts.

A directory/file can be considered to be **effectively locked** for exclusive access if any of the directories on its path is already locked for exclusive access -- this is because no client will be able to obtain any kind of lock until the "blocking" exclusive lock is released.  This is a direct
consequence of the locking order described above.  As such, if a directory is locked for exclusive access, the entire subtree under that directory can also be considered to be locked for exclusive access.  If a client takes advantage of this fact to lock a directory and then perform several reads and/or writes under it, the naming server may lose track of file state; if a client locks a
directory and then writes to files in the directory, the naming server may not know that other replicas of these files need to be invalidated or updated.  This is a limitation of this file system design.

A minimal amount of fairness is guaranteed with locking.  Clients are served in a first-come first-served order, with a slight modification.  If multiple clients request shared access of the same object, these locks can be granted simultaneously.  However, if any exclusive lock request is waiting for the lock on the object, no additional shared locks should be granted, otherwise the exclusive lock request may wait forever, leading to starvation.  Instead, any shared lock requests that arrive after an exclusive lock request should wait until the exclusive lock is granted and released.  For example, suppose clients `A` and `B` currently hold a shared lock on a file, and `C` has requested exclusive access to the same file.  If another client `D` requests shared access to the file, this request should be queued until both
`A` and `B` release the shared lock, `C` is granted the exclusive lock, and `C` releases the exclusive lock.

### Request from client

**Command**: `/lock`

**Method**: `POST`

**Input Data**:
```json
{
    "path": "/path/to/file/or/dir",
    "exclusive": true
}
```

* *path*: string containing the path to the file/directory to be locked
* *exclusive*: `true` for requesting exclusive access or `false` for shared access

A sample Java class representing this command can be found at `common/LockRequest.java`.

### Successful response to client

**Code**: `200 OK`

**Content**: empty (no response needed for successful lock, as the OK grants access itself)

### Error response to client

**Code**: `404 Not Found`

**Content**:
```json
{
    "exception_type": "FileNotFoundException",
    "exception_info": "the file/directory cannot be found"
}
```

* *exception_type*: can be `FileNotFoundException` if the file/directory does not exist or `IllegalArgumentException` if the path is otherwise invalid
* *exception_info*: you can put whatever information is useful for your own debugging purposes.
